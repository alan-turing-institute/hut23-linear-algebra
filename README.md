Overall plan:

- Follow Axler (by subchapter) until we feel comfortable moving to
  applications, then move between books.
- Use Slack channel for collaborative working between meetings.
- Go over exercises and points of confusion together in meetings, as
  people want, in the shared Overleaf.

### Expectations

- Very different backgrounds and interests in this group
- Want everyone to be comfortable: rather be too slow than too fast.
- We should only use the maths and terminology we know so far.
- We don't expect to learn new maths in the session -- it's a chance
  to try out what we've read.
- Meta-goal is to learn how to “speak maths,” and to explain maths
  to others, without feeling overwhelmed.

### Reading material

- [_Linear Algebra Done Right_ (Axler)](https://linear.axler.net/)
- [_Mathematics for Machine Learning_](https://mml-book.github.io/)

### Links

- Overleaf, for writing in the sessions: See the [Slack
  channel](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/archives/C05QNLDKHEG)
