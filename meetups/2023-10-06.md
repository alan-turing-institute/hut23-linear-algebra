1. Where are we going?

   - Overview by JG/RJ

2. Plan

   - Follow Axler (by subchapter) until we feel comfortable moving to
     applications, then move between books.
   - Go over exercises together in meetings, as people want, in the
     shared Overleaf. (JG happy to be scribe and will try to ensure we
     don't go too fast.)
   - Discuss things in meetings.

3. Expectations

   - Very different backgrounds and interests in this group
   - Want everyone to be comfortable: rather be too slow than too
     fast. (cf, Rust reading group)
   - We should only use the maths and terminology we know so far (JG
     will update the reference)
   - We don't expect to learn new maths in the session -- it's a chance to
     try out what we've read. 
   - Part of exercise is to learn how to “speak maths,” and to explain
     maths to others, without feeling overwhelmed.
