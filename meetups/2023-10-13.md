## Q.10 

> Find $x \in \mathbf{R}^4$ such that $$(4, -3, 1, 7) + 2x = (5, 9, -6, 8)$$

An element of $\mathbf{R}^4$ is a tuple of four numbers, say $x =
(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$.

The definition of addition in $\mathbf{R}^4$ is “add together
corresponding components,” and the definition of multiplication by a
number is “multiply all the components by that number” (see “All the
maths we know”). That is: $$(4, -3, 1, 7) + 2x = (4+2x_1, -3+2x_2,
1+2x_3, 7+2x_4) = (5, 9, -6, 8).$$

Equating the first component of the tuples gives $4+2x_1 = 5$, and
therefore $x_1 = 1/2$. Similarly, the second, third, and fourth
components give $x_2 = 6$, $x_3 = -7/2$, and $x_4=1/2$ respectively.

There is another way to approach this problem, one which is perhaps
more “natural” for “things that live in $\mathbf{R}^4$”:

Start with $$(4, -3, 1, 7) + 2x = (5, 9, -6, 8).$$ 
subtract $(4, -3, 1, 7)$ from both sides to get $$2x = (1, 12, -7,
1).$$ 
Finally, divide both sides by 2 to obtain $$x = (1/2, 6, -7/2, 1/2).$$ 


## Q.11

> Explain why there does not exists a $\lambda \in \mathbf{C}$ such
> that $$\lambda (2 - 3i, 5 + 4i, -6 + 7i) = (12 - 5i, 7 + 22i, -32 - 9i).$$

For this equation to be true, each component on the right must be the
same multiple, $\lambda$, of the corresponding component on the
right. (That follows from the definition of scalar multiplication in
$\mathbf{R}^3$.) In general this will not be true. 

Equating the first components says:
$$ \lambda (2 - 3i) = 12 -5i,$$
and therefore
$$ \lambda = \frac{12-5i}{2-3i}$$.
There's a standard trick to dividing one complex number by another
(which question 1 gets you to do explicitly). That is to multiply both
the numerator and denominator by a complex number so that the result
in the denominator is purely real:
$$\frac{12-5i}{2-3i} = \frac{12-5i}{2-3i}\times \frac{2+3i}{2+3i} 
= \frac{(12-5i)(2+3i)}{(2-3i)(2+3i)} = \frac{39 + 26i}{13} = 3 + 2i$$.

The same calculation for all the components is:
$$\frac{12-5i}{2-3i} = 3 + 2i \quad\text{and}\quad
\frac{7+22i}{5+4i} = 3 + 2i; \quad\text{but}\quad
\frac{-32-9i}{-6+7i} = (129 + 278i) / 85.$$
