## Question 5

Find a number $t$ such that $`{(3,1,4), (2,−3,5), (5,9,𝑡)\}`$
is not linearly independent in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

## Question 9

Prove or give a counterexample: If $v_1$, $v_2$, ..., $v_m$ is a
linearly independent list of vectors in $V$, then $$5v_1 − 4v_2, v_2,
v_3, \dotsc , v_m$$ is linearly
independent.

## Question 12

Suppose $v_1$, ..., $v_m$ is linearly independent in $V$ and $w
\subset V$. Prove that if $v_1 + w$, ..., $v_m + w$ is linearly
dependent, then $w \not\in \mathoperator{span}(v_1, \dotsc, v_m)$.

## Question 17

Prove that $V$ is infinite-dimensional if and only if there is a
sequence $v_1$, $v_2$, ... of vectors in $V$ such that $v_1$, $v_2$,
..., $v_m$ is linearly independent for every positive integer $m$.
