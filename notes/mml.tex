\section*{Introduction}

Here are three problems which all seem to have something in common:

\begin{enumerate}
\item An ``urban farm'' grows crops underground in a vacant tunnel. To
  monitor environmental conditions, temperature sensors are placed at
  various locations around the tunnel. The farmers would like a sense
  of the temperature at arbitrary locations.
\item A data scientist is asked to create a model to predict the
  species of a penguin, given some facts about its weight, flipper
  size and bill size.
\item An economist wants to understand whether there is a relationship
  between measures of childhood education and later income.
\end{enumerate}

In each of these examples we believe that there is, in the world, some
sort of map, or function, from an “input” to an “output.” In the first
example, the input is “physical location” and the output is
“temperature;” in the second, the input is “triple of morphological
measurements” and the output is “species;” in the third, the input is
whatever measures of childhood education are used, and the output is,
say, “income at age 30.”

Our challenge is to make a mathematical model of this relationship. In
order to do so, we are provided with “data”---namely a set of pairs of
input and output. The mathematical model of the relationship that we
determine is supposed to match this data, more or less.

On the other hand, there are significant differences between these
problems. In the second and third examples, the map we are seeking
exists somehow \emph{in potentia}, as a relationship between
characteristics of a particular “observational unit” (penguins and
people, respectively). In the first, by contrast, the map just “is” a
thing in the world---the temperature exists at each point in space. The
third example has a “causal” flavour: we presumably hope to be able to
\emph{affect} the output by changing the input. In the second, the
inputs are immutable. Temperature and income take values in a
continuous, totally-ordered set but species comes from a finite,
unordered set. 

Can we capture the similarities between these problems in a way that
will let us attempt to solve them? In each example, there is given a
set $X$ and a set $Y$ and a collection of pairs $(x_i, y_i)\in X\times Y$$
(for $i=1,\dots,N$). Consider the challenge of finding a map,
$\tilde{f}\colon X\to Y$, having the property that $\tilde{f}(x_i)= y_i$
for each~$i$.








\section*{Notes on the original text}

Like most machine learning techniques, linear regression involves the
representation of a particular real-world problem by mathematical
objects, as well as the use of mathematical methods to solve the
problem. Therefore, in writing an exposition of the subject, one will
move between informal descriptions and formal mathematics; between the
real world and the mathematical world.

It is important that the reader is clear at each point which is which!
Mathematically-inclined texts often conflate informal descriptions and
formal definitions, either by failing to give a proper definition when
one was presaged, or by dropping into heavy mathematics before
clarifying the question. 

For example, Deisenroth \emph{et al.}\ begin as
follows.\footnote{There is one other sentence before this but it
merely introduces the chapter. I've numbered the sentences for ease of
reference; these numbers are not part of the original text. And I have
omitted one other sentence that is not important here.}

 [1] In \emph{regression}, we aim to find a function $f$ that maps
 inputs $\bm{x} \in \setR^D$ to corresponding function values $f(\bm{x})
 \in\setR$. [2] We assume that we are given a set of training inputs
 $\bm{x}_n$ and corresponding noisy observations $y_n = f(\bm{x}_n) +
 \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is an i.i.d.\ random variable that describes
 measurement/observation noise and potentially unmodeled processes
 [...]. [3] Our task is to find a function that not only models the
 training data, but generalizes well [...].
